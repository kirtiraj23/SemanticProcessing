##### Concepts and Terms

--Terms act as handles to concepts and the notion of ‘concepts’ gives us a way to represent the ‘meaning’ of a given text.

##### Predicate

--predicate gives us a simple model to process the meaning of complex statements,processing meaning involves understanding the associations between entities.  For e.g. "A football team is comprised of 11 players" is an example of relation type =1 (since there is only one entity type - football players), though the relationship instance is 11 (since there are 11 instances of the entity).

--A predicate is a function which takes in some parameters and returns True or False depending on the relationship between the parameters. For example, a predicate teacher_teaches_course(P = professor Mohan, C = Semantic analysis) returns True.

##### Reification
-- reification refers to combining multiple entity types to convert them into lower order predicates.
